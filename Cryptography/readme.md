# Cryptography
```bash
**1.reverse_cipher.py** :-> This file is to test the encryption and decryption in console.
**2.encryt_file.py **:-> This file is to encrypt complete file.
**decrypt_file.py** :-> This file is to decrypt pre-encrypted file.
```
### Creativity
In this algorithm of encryption I only used shift cipher and reverse_cipher.
But to get more randomness I used to encrypt the password also.
As the user password may be very small or may be of very repeatitive characters.
To get rid of that **I encrypted the password first and then added the original password to it to increase the length of password**.
