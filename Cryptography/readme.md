# Cryptography

### Creativity
In this algorithm of **encryption/decryption** I  used shift cipher and reverse_cipher.
But to get more randomness I used to encrypt the password also.
As the user password may be very small or may be of very repeatitive characters.
To get rid of that **I encrypted the password first and then added the original password to it to increase the length of password**.
